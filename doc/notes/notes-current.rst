Notes for BIND 9.18.22
----------------------

Security Fixes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Parsing DNS messages with many different names could cause excessive
  CPU load. This has been fixed. :cve:`2023-4408`

  ISC would like to thank Shoham Danino from Reichman University, Anat
  Bremler-Barr from Tel-Aviv University, Yehuda Afek from Tel-Aviv
  University, and Yuval Shavitt from Tel-Aviv University for bringing
  this vulnerability to our attention. :gl:`#4234`

- Specific queries could cause :iscman:`named` to crash with an
  assertion failure when :any:`nxdomain-redirect` was enabled. This has
  been fixed. :cve:`2023-5517` :gl:`#4281`

- A bad interaction between DNS64 and serve-stale could cause
  :iscman:`named` to crash with an assertion failure, when both of these
  features were enabled. This has been fixed. :cve:`2023-5679`
  :gl:`#4334`
